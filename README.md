# Neighbor.ly

## üí° Inspiration

The past year and half we‚Äôve been isolated from friends & family. We can‚Äôt see or help our loved ones who might have difficulty moving. Small businesses are struggling and are on the brink of closing. And then there are people who want to help volunteer, but don‚Äôt know where to start. Let‚Äôs rebuild our neighborhood and get neighborly. Our community needs help & what's a better way to bring volunteer than making it more rewarding and accessible for all!

## üè°  What it does

Neighbor.ly allows for users wanting to volunteer to find volunteering opportunities that are close to them and align with their skill sets. Neighbor.ly also allows for business and neighbors in need to request for help & support from people in the community. Users who successfully complete their volunteer task receive hood points, our own cryptocurrency, and are able to redeem gift cards or donations to reputable charities of their choice. 

**Community**
* Neighbor.ly allows volunteers nearby or far to help rebuild communities that have been struggling due to Covid-19. However, once the pandemic is over our app can still help connect those that need help (elderly, people with disabilities, people with financial struggles, etc.) find people to help them out.

## üî® How we built it

**Technologies Used**

_Google Docs & Draw_
* We used google docs during the ideating & brainstorming phase.
* We used Google draw to map out features & MVPs.

_Figma_
* We made the design system & branding on Figma (color, typography, etc.).
* Then, We made wireframes.
* Lastly, We made low & high-fidelity.

**Design Process**
* Problem: During the pandemic, our communities are struggling to find free help to rebuild their lives or help with simple task that hard to do, due to isolation/quarantine.
* Question (HMW): How might we help match eager volunteers to communities in need?
* We will need to: Make an application that is easy and fun to use that helps business and individuals ask for help and volunteers find ways to help their community.
* Solution: A web app that rewards volunteers that take on the task published on our site.
* Impact: It will allow for businesses and individuals receive free help and get back on it's feet. It will allow for people that struggle to do things, like disabled folks, a helping hand.
* User Personas: _See Slides_
* Main audience: Business Owners, Volunteers (16-21 yrs old), and Elderly & Disabled Individuals.
* Design System: Used green & blue to resemble earth and how we bringing help from all around the world. And give our application are more homely feel.
